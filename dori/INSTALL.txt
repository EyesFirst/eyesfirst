                  EYESFIRST DORI WEB INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

DORI Web is split into two projects: the DORI Browser Grails web application,
and the DICOM Uploader Applet, which is used to anonymize DICOM files prior to
them being uploaded to the DORI server.

The DORI Web software is in the "dori-web" directory and is a Grails 1.3
project. The DICOM Uploader Applet is in the "dicom-uploader-applet" directory
and is a Maven 2.x project.

-----------------
REQUIRED SOFTWARE
-----------------

Before you can run DORI Web, you will need to install the following required
software:

-------
MySQL 5
-------

<http://www.mysql.com/>

If you are using Linux, your OS almost certainly will provide MySQL 5 packages.
Exactly how to install them varies by OS, but generally speaking:

RedHat:

    sudo yum install mysql5-server

Debian (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.):

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.5

For all other OSes, go to the MySQL downloads page
<http://www.mysql.com/downloads/> and download the appropriate installer from
there.

------------------------
Java Runtime Environment
------------------------

If you are compiling the code, you will require the Java Development Kit (JDK).
It is available from Oracle:
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>

You should use Java SE 6u31 or later or Java SE 7u3 or later.

If you are using Linux, your distribution most likely provides a version of the
OpenJDK. While the OpenJDK is not the Oracle JDK, it should work with DORI Web
(although this has not been exstensively tested).

--------
DCM4CHEE
--------

<http://www.dcm4che.org/>

DORI Web acts as a front end to DCM4CHEE and does not store DICOM images on its
own.

Follow the installation instructions for DCM4CHEE:
<http://www.dcm4che.org/confluence/display/ee2/Installation>

------------
Grails 1.3.7
------------

<http://grails.org/>

DORI Web is currently built against Grails 1.3.7 and has not been tested with
the newer versions.

Download it from <http://grails.org/Download> and follow the installation
instructions.

----
SOLR
----

<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>

The Solr configuration is in the "solr" directory. Essentially you should be
able to point your Solr home to be the "solr/solr" directory and it should work.

The current tested version is SOLR 3.5.0.
