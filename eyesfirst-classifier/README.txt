GETTING EVERYTHING TO BUILD

Building most of the artifacts can be accomplished using:

    mvn package

From this directory. However, you will need to have MATLAB installed to build
the Retinal Thickness Classifier, or have a pre-built binary already installed.
These components WILL NOT build without MATLAB.

To install the required Java library, run:

    ant -f retinal-thickness/install-mcr.xml -Dmatlab=/path/to/matlab/R2011b

This will install a local copy of the "javabuilder" JAR which is required to
compile and run the MATLAB code.

This makes the WAR files generated by this system-specific, as the "javabuilder"
JAR file is platform-dependent. This only effects the image-processor binaries,
as they need to include a copy somewhere.

You can use these binaries on another system, but if you do, you MUST replace
the "javabuilder.jar" file (which is located inside of
image-processor-webapp.war, in "/WEB-INF/processor-lib").
