This currently uses the DCM4CHE2 2.0.27 toolkit which, at the time of this
writing, is not available in any public Maven repository. So you'll have to
build and install it yourself.

Download it from <www.dcm4che.org/confluence/display/d2/dcm4che2+DICOM+Toolkit>
and then use Maven to install it. (Basically, unzip it, CD into the created
directory, and run "mvn install".)

Unfortunately, you are likely to run into a dependency on the Java Advanced
ImageIO library, which Sun no longer provides for download. (And neither does
Oracle, now that they're Oracle.)

If you have an appropriate copy of the JAR, you'll need to make it available
to Maven using the following command:

    mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jai_imageio-1.1.jar -DgroupId=com.sun.media -DartifactId=jai_imageio -Dversion=1.1 -Dpackaging=jar

Note the -Dfile=jai_imageio-1.1jar part. You need to make sure that points at the
ImageIO JAR you're using.
